[Modcloth](http://modcloth.com)\n>2. [Renttherunway](http://renttherunway.com)\n>\n>[[1]](#references) ModCloth sells women’s vintage clothing and accessories, from which the curator of the dataset collected data from three categories: dresses, tops, and bottoms. RentTheRunWay is a unique platform that allows women to rent clothes for various occasions; they collected data from several categories. \n>\n>**Note:** In both datasets, fit feedback belongs to one of three classes: ‘Small,’ ‘Fit,’ and ‘Large.’ And also, some [assumptions](#assumptions) have been made about the features in the dataset."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Suppressing all warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.rc('figure', figsize = (20, 8))\nmatplotlib.rc('font', size = 14)\nmatplotlib.rc('axes.spines', top = False, right = False)\nmatplotlib.rc('axes', grid = False)\nmatplotlib.rc('axes', facecolor = 'white')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0afe5de71cb8f3be40b3ed12413d7f9cea6f7cf3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2\"></a>\n#  [Modcloth](http://modcloth.com) Dataset\n<a id=\"3\"></a>\n## Importing data using Pandas\nTaking a look at the first few lines of the modcloth data's json file using the inbuilt OS bash command-head.

There are missing values across the dataframe, which need to be handled.\n2. Cup-size contains multiple preferences- which will need handling, if we wish to define cup sizes as 'category' datatype.\n3. Height column needs to be parsed for extracting the height in a numerical quantity, it looks like a string (object) right now.\n4. Not so important, but some columns could do with some r
